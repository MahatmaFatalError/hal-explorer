You can play with a running demo https://chatty42.herokuapp.com/hal-explorer/index.html#theme=Cosmo&url=https://chatty42.herokuapp.com/api[here].
I host this demo at Heroku, so please give it a little time to warm up (This might take up to 1 minute).

## Development server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project in production mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Gradle/Java Build Support

If you have Java installed, you can also build the project with Gradle. The Gradle build will install node.js locally in the project directory.
Run `./gradlew build` to build the project in production mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.
