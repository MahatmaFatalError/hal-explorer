== Demo

You can play with a running demo https://chatty42.herokuapp.com/hal-explorer/index.html#theme=Cosmo&url=https://chatty42.herokuapp.com/api[here].
I host this demo at Heroku, so please give it a little time to warm up (This might take up to 1 minute).

== Development Server

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:4200/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

== Build

Run `npm run build` to build the project in production mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Gradle/Java Build Support

If you have Java installed, you can also build the project with Gradle. The Gradle build will install node.js locally in the project directory.
Run `./gradlew build` to build the project in production mode. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

== Intergration in your Backends

The easiest way to integrate HAL Explorer into your backend would be to clone this Git repo, do a production build and then copy the content of the dist folder to a location accessable by your backend server. When you use Spring Boot, a good location in your projects source tree would be src/main/java/resources/static/hal-explorer. See https://github.com/toedter/chatty for a concrete integration example.

== Running Tests

Run `npm test` to run the unit test suite against your default browser,
run `npm test` to run the unit test suite against headless Chrome.

To run the e2e tests you must have Docker installed.
The e2e tests start a real Spring Boot based backend in a Docker container which is then used by HAL Explorer.
